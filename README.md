### Project Description
This is a simple, lightweight version of the Travel Bucket List Planner website using basic web technologies. It's a great project to get familiar with JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and localStorage, while keeping things simple and effective.

### The Problem statement
Planning a trip can be overwhelming, especially when you have a long bucket list of destinations to visit. This
project aims to simplify the process by providing a user-friendly interface to add, display, and remove destinations
from your bucket list.

### The Solution
The solution is a simple web application that allows users to add destinations to their bucket list, display the
destinations, and remove them when they've been visited. The application uses JavaScript to handle user input
and DOM manipulation, and localStorage to persist the data even after the user closes the browser.
